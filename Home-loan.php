                        <li><strong>HOME LOAN FIXED RATE OF INTEREST:</strong> As the name suggest, fixed rate of interest on home loan remain fixed for entire loan tenure. Fixed rate of interest do not have any impact of market fluctuations.  The main disadvantage of fixed rate of interest is that it is usually higher than floating rate of interest by 1% to 2.50%. Not only this but also if rate of interest on home loan decreases any time during the entire loan tenure, fixed rate of interest remain same and home loan borrower have to pay same EMI.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><strong>HOME LOAN FLOATING RATE OF INTEREST:</strong> Floating rate of interest changes with the market condition. Floating rate of interest includes base rate plus margin. So whenever bank or NBFC changes there base rate the floating rate of interest on home loan gets changed. Benefit of floating rate of interest is that it is cheaper than fixed rate of interest of home loan.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p style="line-height: 24px;text-align: justify;font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif;">As floating rate of interest is always lower than fixed rate of interest of home loan so, majority of home loan borrowers choose floating rate of interest. As a borrower, it is advisable to compare home loan interest rates of different bank and NBFC and chose the best one which suits your need.</p>

                            <li class="mt-3"><strong>Budgeting:</strong> Buying a property from own pocket is not possible for all of us, it is a very big and life time investment, so home loan is the best way to purchase a property but before taking home loan it is necessary to do proper budgeting. Bank or NBFC will give you loan maximum 75% to 80% of cost of property or market value whichever is lower. So before taking home loan it is necessary to keep 20% to 25% margin money or own contribution with other charges like stamp duty, registration charges, loan processing fees, brokerage etc. </li>
                            <li class="mt-3"><strong>Loan Eligibility:</strong> Once budgeting is finalized then check your home loan eligibility, that how much loan you can take from bank or NBFC. All the banks or NBFC have different product and policy to calculate the loan eligibility. Loan eligibility also depends upon so many other factors like age, income, cibil score, work profile and financial stability etc.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3"><strong>Rate Of Interest:</strong> Before taking home loan, check rate of interest charged by different bank or NBFC as it has a major impact on your EMI. If rate of interest is high then EMI is also high, so choose the bank which provides lower rate of interest so EMI will not put extra loads on your EMI.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3"><strong>Loan Processing Fees:</strong> Bank or financial institution charges loan processing fees to process your home loan application. There are two types of charges one is loan processing fees and another one is loan administration charges. Loan processing fee is taken by the bank or NBFC to process your loan application. It could be a fixed percentage of your loan amount or a fixed amount. Loan administration charges are taken by lender to maintain your loan account after disbursement.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3"><strong>Home Loan Terms And Conditions:</strong> Bank or NBFC laid down several conditions related to balance transfer of home loan to another lender, pre-closure charges, part payment charges etc. It is advisable to read all the terms and conditions before choosing the best bank.</li>
